# Supreme Hacker Terminal Simulator

A visual terminal simulator that recreates the dramatic "hacking" scenes from movies and TV shows. This project generates colorful, animated terminal output that mimics what Hollywood thinks hacking looks like.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**THIS IS NOT A REAL HACKING TOOL**

This script is created for **entertainment and educational purposes only**. It:

- Does not perform any actual hacking or system penetration
- Cannot be used to gain unauthorized access to any systems
- Does not contain any malicious code or exploits
- Is purely a visual simulation with fake, randomly-generated output
- Cannot harm your computer or any network

## 🎬 Features

- Matrix-style digital rain animations
- Colorful progress bars and status updates
- Simulated "breaches" of fake high-value targets
- Realistic-looking but completely fictional error messages
- Dramatic visual effects and typing animations
- Fake data "exfiltration" displays
- Simulated decryption animations
- Cool ASCII art banner

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Best experienced in a full-screen terminal with a dark background

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/selytheng/hacker_visualize.git
   cd hacker_visualize
   ```

2. No additional dependencies required!

## 💻 Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python hacker_visualize_v2.0.py
```

Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to trigger the emergency shutdown sequence.

## 🎥 Perfect For

- Film or TV show props
- Cybersecurity awareness presentations
- Computer lab demonstrations
- Entertaining backgrounds during tech presentations
- Learning about terminal color codes and animations
- Laughing at Hollywood's portrayal of "hacking"

## 📚 Educational Value

Despite being purely visual, this script can help teach concepts like:
- Terminal colors and formatting
- Python threading
- Real-time console output
- Random data generation
- User interruption handling

## 🔍 Code Structure

The script consists of various functions that create different visual effects:

- `supreme_hacker_mode()`: Main function that orchestrates the visual simulation
- `display_matrix_rain()`: Creates Matrix-style digital rain effect
- `progress_bar()`: Displays animated progress bars
- `run_decryption_animation()`: Simulates decrypting files
- `fake_data_exfiltration()`: Visualizes stealing files
- `interactive_typing()`: Types text character by character
- `background_effect_thread()`: Creates random glitch effects

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to fork this project and add your own Hollywood hacker effects!

1. Add more realistic-looking (but fake) hacker messages
2. Create new visual effects
3. Improve the ASCII art
4. Make the animations smoother

Remember: Actual hacking without authorization is illegal and unethical. This tool is meant to poke fun at Hollywood's unrealistic portrayal of hacking and provide entertainment only.
